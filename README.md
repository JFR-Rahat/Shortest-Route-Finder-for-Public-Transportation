# Shortest-Route-Finder-for-Public-Transportation
Project Overview:
This project is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between districts of Bangladesh. The distances between the districs are taken as static values. It has three travelling methods, by cars, by trains or by both.

How it works:
1. Upon running the C code of the project, it prompts a window asking the user to selct their preffered method for travelling, by cars, by trains, or the best route. 
2. After selecting a method, the user is again asked to provide the source district and the destination district.
3. The user will be shown a path from the source to destination that is the shortest possible.
4. The user can continue searching for routes with the current method, or he/she can go back to Home screen to select a different method or quit the program.
